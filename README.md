# PL Grad Schools

Finding grad schools that fit your interests can be a daunting task. Rather than making a ranking of the 'best' grad schools using some subjective metric, we decided to list out grad schools with professors studying PL that are open to take new students.

Feel free to make a PR adding other schools to the list. (Or remove them if the PL faculty are no longer there.) Also feel free to add new sub-areas that have not been covered yet.
