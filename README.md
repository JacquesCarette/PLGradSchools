# PL Grad Schools

Finding grad schools that fit your interests can be a daunting task. Rather than making a ranking of the 'best' grad schools using some subjective metric, we decided to list out grad schools with professors studying PL that are open to take new students.

Feel free to make a PR adding other schools/faculty/topics to the list. Or remove them if the PL faculty are no longer there. We want this to be a living list of active PL schools for new students/postdocs/etc.
